##Stock Trends

This app shows the current stock trends in a svg line chart. You can add any stock by its symbol to see its prices  for the last month. You can also delete any stock you don't want.

It is a great app for comparing stock prices. It also syncs across clients in realtime using web sockets.

This was made as part of a [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) basejump.
